## Resources
* [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/)
    * I reference EditorConfig for every project just to make sure I write out the properties accurately.

* ### Canvas Pages & JavaScript Resources

    * [Arrays & Objects](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/330762/pages/arrays-and-objects?module_item_id=6205767)

        * I used the Array and Objects page on Canvas as a refresher. I feel pretty comfortable with arrays and objects independently, but the multiple objects inside of the array made me think critically. The Canvas page was a helpful launching point for figuring out the syntax.

    * [Appending to an Array - Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/351409/appending-to-array)

        * I wasn't quite sure whether you were looking for a multi-line array, a concatenated statement, or some other JavaScript type to add the fourth string, so I basically looked it up via Google search and found how to append the string using a `push();` function.

    * [Identifiers & Functions](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/330762/pages/javascript-identifiers-and-functions?module_item_id=6205772)

        * I relied on this Canvas page heavily since I struggle a lot with functions. I particularly looked at the first three function examples.

    * [Function Expression - Mozilla Development Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)

        * This is just a helpful reference that helped me double-check how to write out a function expression. I pretty much looked exclusively at the highlighted function syntax at the top of the page.

* ### Filler Content

    * [Presidents & Vice Presidents](http://www.presidentsusa.net/presvplist.html)

        * This website has a convenient list of information about the US presidents, including their term length/ years in presidency and political affiliation.

## Comments

**Thank you so much for taking great pains to go over functions with me!** I know it took forever but I definitely feel like I have a better understanding for what the assignment was calling for. I'm sure I'll need to continue studying and practicing to be able to confidently write my own functions, but I think I can at least recognize the process now.
